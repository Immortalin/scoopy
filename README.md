A way for academics and research students to stay on top of research publications (using machine learning)

Currently, Scoopy is a terminal-based interactive RSS reader, but eventually I intend it to use scikit-learn to recommend relevant journal articles.

The default feed list is based on my own research interests. 

## Dependencies:

```
-- Python 2.7
-- feedparser: https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser
-- scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org
```
